DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SPRING-MVC AND SPRING RESTFUL APPLICATIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------

The main difference between a normal Spring MVC application and a Spring RESTful web service lies
in their core purpose and architectural approach.

A normal Spring MVC application is designed to serve dynamic web pages, typically rendered on the
server-side using technologies like Thymeleaf or JSP. These pages are then sent back to the client
(typically a web browser) for rendering. The focus is on providing a complete, user-friendly web
interface.

On the other hand, a Spring RESTful web service is designed to expose a set of well-defined,
language-agnostic APIs that can be consumed by various clients, such as web applications, mobile
apps, or other services. These APIs communicate via standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
and respond with data in a lightweight, machine-readable format, such as JSON or XML.

The key differences are:

Purpose: A normal Spring MVC application is primarily focused on providing a rich, interactive user
experience, while a Spring RESTful web service is focused on exposing reusable, interoperable APIs.

Client Interaction: MVC applications typically render full web pages on the server and send them to
the client. RESTful web services send back data in a lightweight format, allowing the client to
handle the presentation and logic.

Response Format: MVC applications commonly return HTML pages, while RESTful web services return data
in formats like JSON or XML.

Statelessness: RESTful web services are generally stateless, meaning each request is independent and
self-contained. MVC applications may maintain session state to provide a more interactive user
experience.

*Caching*: RESTful web services often leverage caching mechanisms more extensively to improve
performance and scalability, as the data they return is typically more cacheable than full web pages.

*Security*: RESTful web services often utilize token-based authentication (e.g., JWT) or API keys,
while MVC applications may rely more on session-based authentication.


In summary, Spring MVC is more focused on providing a complete, server-rendered web application,
while Spring RESTful web services are designed to expose reusable, interoperable APIs that can be
consumed by various clients.
